# Caesar Cipher :envelope:

[Fourth assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/caesar-cipher) of The Odin Project.

#### What is Caesar Cipher?

One of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
